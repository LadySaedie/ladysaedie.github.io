He stumbled so unexpectedly out of the barely open elevator doors that I nearly strode right into him.

I stopped. Just. Unnoticed by him.

And I watched this thin, be-sticked cardigan of a man shuffle and slipper along. 

He was ill, gravely. A dead man huffing; 
 - yet, with each and every step of his enfeebled gait 
     he moved with grit and guts;
       the soldier surviving. 

And I beheld the dauntless indomitable fortitude of heroic steps.
