A third my age, you awoke in me the man half my age.  
My cause was lost before it began.  
My reason's voice drowned in unheeded, hopeless pleas,  
and I fell, stumbling deep into the pit of want.  

In words more eloquent than I can pen,  
I have loved and lost, and now I wait in melancholy agony  
for the poet’s better,  
which never comes.  

So, go now about your two-thirds,  
and leave this half-man be;  
living a memory that never was.

*This poem sprang wholly from my own reflections in 2025. After writing it, I came across something Kierkegaard wrote about the pain of "remembering the future you'll never have". I also came across something that Schopenhauer wrote about no one living in the past, disappointing or otherwise. The similarity between these two great philosophers' thoughts and my humble poem are delightfully affirming but remain entirely coincidental. The central image and phrasing in my poem, especially '...living a memory that never was...' are original to me.*
