A third my age, you awoke in me the man half my age.  
My cause was lost before it began.  
My reason's voice drowned in unheeded, hopeless pleas,  
and I fell, stumbling deep into the pit of want.  

In words more eloquent than I can pen,  
I have loved and lost, and now I wait in melancholy agony  
for the poetâ€™s better,  
which never comes.  

So, go now about your two-thirds,  
and leave this half-man be;  
living a memory that never was.
