*I've just sent this out in our weekly school newsletter (The School Pennywhistle section), prompted by the heartbreaking news from Thanda Primary in Mpumalanga last week, where a little Grade R girl was killed by a reversing school bus. It comes on the heels of other awful incidents, like the Vanderbijlpark taxi crash a couple of weeks ago that killed 14 children, and at least two school-driveway deaths last year. These stories have shaken me deeply, and they have stirred me to act, as principal of the school, to prevent anything like this ever happening at Little Star.*  


Dear Parents,  

Given the recent spate of vehicle accidents involving children, I have something to confess.  

About thirty years ago, I knocked over a child. No harm done, but it could have been so much worse.  

I was driving away after dropping Sarah off at Warner Beach Junior Primary one busy morning, when, all of a sudden, a child darted out in front of me from between two parked cars. I swerved instinctively and screeched to a halt. I heard the bang as the car hit her, but I’d managed to avoid driving over her. I leapt out and ran to the front. Nothing. I looked under the car in a panic. Nothing. I couldn’t explain it. I had definitely hit something. Then I ran to the pavement, and there she was, crying, while her dad was giving her a telling-off.  

I apologised to the young dad. “I’m SO sorry! I didn’t see her!” I said. I recognised him as a pupil I’d taught at Kingsway High years before. He said he’d seen everything and that she’d run into my car. Hands on knees, I bent over to make sure she was all right, and then got back into my car. I could barely drive. I was shaken to my core.  

You know, to this day, over thirty years later, I still play that incident over and over in my head, like it was only yesterday, running through all the ‘what-ifs’ in an endless, haunting loop. What if I’d been one second earlier? What if I hadn’t swerved? What if I hadn’t been paying attention? What if I’d been going a bit faster? What if? What if? The dreadful outcome remains the same each time: I would have driven over her and killed her.  

That no lasting harm was done is no excuse and brings no respite, and no amount of trying to forgive myself, or thanking God and our guardian angels for the way things turned out brings consolation or closure. You don't ever get over something like that.  

So, when I talk to you in the driveway about the way you just drove up, or the way you just parked, or the way you just let your child amble unsupervised behind parked cars on their way up to the school gate, you’ll understand why I get emotional. It’s not judgement. It’s a living memory…and it’s a plea to keep our little ones safe.

*At Little Star, we remain resolute in our commitment to safety: children are not permitted to walk unattended in the school driveway during drop-off and pick-up times. Please get out of your car and walk your child to and from the school gate. This rule will be strictly enforced, and parents will be heavily fined for breaking it. Every child must hold the hand of a responsible adult and walk only on the designated path in front of the parked cars, not behind them. We ask all parents, caregivers, and taxi drivers to support us in keeping our little ones safe in the school driveway.*
