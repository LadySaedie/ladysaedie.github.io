I don’t remember how old I was exactly when this incident happened, but I was probably fifteen, going on sixteen – the early seventies – over fifty years ago; about the time “Jesus Christ Superstar” was all the rage in the UK. I was at that ungainly age in secondary school when the girls in my class blossomed into alluring adolescent beauties, and I, well, just squeaked and grew pimples.

One such girl was Carol Millington, and she was drop-dead gorgeous. Of course, I fell madly in love with her, along with every other fifteen-year-old boy in the school. I didn’t stand a chance. I was gangly, clumsy, and spotty. I also had no confidence. All I could do was adore her from a distance.

Every Friday morning, during assembly, there’d be an Arts & Culture piece for the whole school to enjoy. Most of the time, this was just our music teacher playing some classical music. He was a concert pianist, after all, and he was really quite good. Once, he even played the theme from ‘The Dam Busters’.  That was brilliant!  

One Friday morning, instead of his usual piano recital, someone came out from the wings and planted a microphone centre stage. He tapped it to check it was working and then walked off. The school went into a quizzical murmur. Our music teacher walked up to the mic and told us that today we were going to be treated to a famous piece of music sung to us by one of our very own. The murmurs increased. He asked us to welcome her on stage. When Carol walked out from the wings, the whole school erupted in spontaneous cheers, whistles and thunderous applause. I didn’t know she could sing! Nor did I know that the whole school knew that she could. I must have been living under a rock.

She smiled nervously, looked down, adjusted the mic, and then looked across at our music teacher at the piano and waited for his cue. He waited for the school to quieten down, and then began playing. Everyone immediately recognised the opening bars of ‘I Don’t Know How To Love Him’ from ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ and erupted all over again, even louder than before. This time, there was lots of ‘shushing’ from all over the hall and the school quickly fell silent again.

She was angelic. I sat spellbound, distracted only for a moment by my best mate, Jonathan – who was normally critical of everything and everyone – turning to me to say, “Crikey!” Carol was lovely. When she finished, the whole school stood and applauded and cheered and whistled like there was no tomorrow. I don’t remember how long we clapped for except that afterwards my hands were sore. Who cares? She. Was. Brilliant. I remember, for the whole time I was clapping for her, all I could think about was telling her how good she was. I knew I had to tell her. I knew I didn’t want to die without telling her. I made up my mind. I was going to tell her. I was going to.

Later that day, I saw Carol sitting by herself on a table, swinging her legs. I couldn’t believe it! There she was: the most popular girl on the planet…all alone! In an exquisitely painful now-or-never moment, I marshalled my quivering courage, walked up to her and turned to stone. She looked at me, instantly smiled and exclaimed, “Philip!” She patted the empty space next to her on the table and said, “Sit!”

I guess the adrenalin and dopamine overload of actually sitting next to Carol all by myself has addled my memory of what happened next. I cannot recall anything we said to each other. Nothing. Not one syllable. Believe me, I have tried to remember, but it’s not there. I hope with all my heart that I told her how good she was at singing. I hope with all my heart that I told her how truly lovely she was. I hope I did. I hope so. Despite not remembering what we said, the lasting memory I have of us is sitting next to each other on that table, swinging our legs, in existential teenage bliss. 

Come Monday, there was a completely different atmosphere at school. Jonathan came up to me said, “I suppose you’ve heard.”

   “Heard what?” I said.

   “Carol’s dead.”

   “What?”

   “Yeah. Died in a fire. Went back in for her dad.”
