## HIS: 

It was the priciest French restaurant he'd ever visited. This was his love-statement to her, whispers of romance and elegance. Even the name 'La Gulue' radiated a tender French warmth.

She couldn’t eat here. She would not eat here. She looked at him. For some absurd reason, he was sitting with his eyes closed idiotically smiling and waving his hands to his nose. Suddenly, her mouth filled with saliva, she instinctively clutched tightly at her mouth with both helpless hands and, just as he opened his eyes...
