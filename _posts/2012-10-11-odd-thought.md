It has always seemed to me an odd thought that animal rights activists and Pro-Life supporters are frequently politically polar opposites: animal rights activists are generally on the political left, and Pro-Life supporters are generally on the political right. I mean, aren’t both ideologies facing in the same direction, that is, towards the sanctity of life?

Even odder, then, is the thought that animal rights activists generally also support abortion rights. Put another way: how can the vocation to rescue the chicken from the chopping block not also extend to rescuing a baby from an abortion? I can’t wrap my head around that inconsistency. It seems counterintuitive. Life is life.

The problem I have with this is that if someone can support the notion that it’s always right to rescue a rat but not a baby, it reveals a moral relativism that contradicts the universal sanctity of life that animal rights activists claim to defend. And that's an odd thought
