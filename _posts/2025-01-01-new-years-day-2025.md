At the pool this morning, the number of goslings swimming aimlessly about - without any means of getting out of the pool - had risen from three to five since yesterday. When the male goose saw me, he honked at me loudly and not in a good way. Geese are both stupid and aggressive which is genetically a terrible combination of traits for animals (sadly, this is also true for humans), so I bade a hasty retreat and closed the gate. I suspect the goslings will be dead by tomorrow: either by drowning or starving. Oh well. I guess stupidity has its merits. I mean, don’t get in if you can’t get out. I missed swimming this morning but swimming among angry geese just didn’t appeal to me.

Mac had to be admitted to hospital this morning. Apparently, his blood is like shit. He needed a five-pint refill. Of course he’s not himself. Two thirds of his blood isn’t his. Reports relayed to us at lunch indicated that he was chipper. They’re trying to find out why his ‘life juice’ isn’t.

It was very nice to see Michael and Bernadette at family lunch at 79. Julie, Tony and Bren came, too. Then, to everyone’s surprise except mine, Sarah and Rudolf arrived with Kiera and Alex. Anne was over the moon. It was a lovely surprise. It was also a lovely lunch.
